# Microservice-A
Microservice A implemented for Software Engineering I course

README must contain...
o	Clear instructions for how to programmatically REQUEST data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call. Do not advise your teammate to use your test program or require them to, your teammate must write all of their own code.
o	Clear instructions for how to programmatically RECEIVE data from the microservice you implemented. Include an example call.
o	UML sequence diagram showing how requesting and receiving data works. Make it detailed enough that your teammate (and your grader) will understand.
